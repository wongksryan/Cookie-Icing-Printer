Vexcode does NOT take nested arrays. As such, the webapp generates a non-nested array.
The code takes into account the following formats; instead of having G1, G2 as commands, raw integers are used to reduce file size.

1 - Lines(point to point):
Array format:
[1, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]

2 - Dot(singular point):
Array format:
[2, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]

1 - Arcs/Circles(point, to guide point, to point):
Array format:
[3, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3]
